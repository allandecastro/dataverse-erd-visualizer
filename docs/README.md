## Tips for Screenshots

1. Use the light mode for better visibility in most contexts
2. Show a few entities with relationships visible
3. Include the sidebar to show filtering options
4. Capture at high resolution for crisp display on GitHub

## Video Recording

For animated demos, consider using:
- [ScreenToGif](https://www.screentogif.com/) (Windows)

- [Peek](https://github.com/phw/peek) (Linux)

Keep GIFs under 10MB for GitHub display.
